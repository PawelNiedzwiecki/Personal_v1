##<p align="center">Personal Website v1</p>

I used modern libraries and tools to create my own personal website. In most cases I used:

- React JS
- Gatsby JS (along with embedded routing)
- Styled Components
- GraphQL
- Markdown
- Web font loader

For the sake of this project I also did a design of the website using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/ "Figma website")
